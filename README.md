# 🍔 Fast Food Restaurant – Fully Dynamic Laravel Website

## 🧑‍💻 Overview
This is a **full-stack dynamic restaurant website** built using **Laravel (backend)** and **MySQL (database)**.  
The entire website is **fully dynamic** — meaning every section, page, and feature can be **managed directly from the admin panel** without touching the code.  

Admins can easily **add, edit, or delete** pages, manage **menus, offers, bookings, feedback**, and even control the **navbar, slider, about, and footer sections** — all from a user-friendly dashboard.
